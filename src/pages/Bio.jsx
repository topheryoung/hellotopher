      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>
        Over the last 10 years, I have had the privaledge of working with and
        for these awesome companies and startups. My career began with a desire
        to mix my Computer Science bachelors degree with great, useable design.
        This convergence has lead me to be a product leader who can work as the
        mixer for design, technology, and business.
